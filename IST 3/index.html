	<h2> About Me </h2>	
		<p> I am a student at Kelso High Campus in year 10. I was born on the 19th of April 2003. I am an avid reader and a cat person. But above all else, I am a Christian. Some indesputible facts: </p>
		<ul>
		<li> Cats are either <em> marginally</em> better than dogs or equal, depending on the weather </li>
		<li> Marvel is superior to DC </li>
		<li> Physical books are better than eBooks </li>
		</ul>
