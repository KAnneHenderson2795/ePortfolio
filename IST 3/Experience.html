<h2> Experience</h2>
	<p>Unlike most students my age I have not done work experience or have a job. But this does not mean I am entirely unexperienced. Where most students have experience doing simple, relatively unskilled jobs, I have experience in a leadership role. For the past two years (this year and the year before) I have helped run <a href = "images/PK+Camp+2019+brochure.pdf" download="PK Camp Brochure">PK Camp </a> as a junior leader. This has given me invaluable experience working with kids, in a team and as a leader. Recently I recieved further leadership training at <a  href = "https://youthworks.net/lit"> LIT</a>, (or Leaders in Training). Whiles not as hands on as PK Camp, I still gained valuable leadership experience. Currently I am also reading the Bible aloud at church. This improves my tone and pace while talking infront of a large group of people. </p>
	<br>
	<p>Through school I have gained many experiences in researching, patience, problem solving and keeping deadlines. </p>
